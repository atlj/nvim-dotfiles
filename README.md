# atlj/neovim_config

## Why?

It's fast, reliable (at least when it works), customizable and fast

## My Keys

| Binding | What it does? |
| --- | --- |
| space | lead key |
| lead e | file manager |
| lead f | fuzzy find files (respects `.gitignore`) |
| lead ; | fuzzy find files (doesn't respect `.gitignore`)|
| lead s | fuzzy find string |
